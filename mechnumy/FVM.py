"""
This module solves differential equations using the Finite Volume Method (FVM),
which is based on the integral form of conservation laws. It is particularly
suited for fluid dynamics and heat transfer problems.

Key Features:
- Flux-based methods for conservation laws.
- Discretization of control volumes for PDEs.
- Support for steady-state and transient simulations.

Example:
    from mechnumy.FVM import solve_fvm
    solution = solve_fvm(grid, flux_function)
