"""
This module implements the Differential Transform Method (DTM), a
semi-analytical numerical method for solving differential equations.
It is particularly useful for linear and non-linear ODEs and PDEs.

Key Features:
- Simplifies the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations.
- Efficient for solving initial value problems and boundary value problems.
- Supports symbolic and numerical transformations.

Example:
    from mechnumy.DTM import solve_dtm
    solution = solve_dtm(equation, initial_conditions)
