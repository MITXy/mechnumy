"""
This module implements the Finite Element Method (FEM) for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) over complex domains. It divides
the problem into smaller finite elements for approximate solutions.

Key Features:
- Support for 1D, 2D, and 3D finite element formulations.
- Handles linear and non-linear PDEs.
- Mesh generation and assembly of stiffness matrices.

Example:
    from mechnumy.FEM import solve_fem
    solution = solve_fem(mesh, boundary_conditions)
