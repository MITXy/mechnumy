"""
This module provides a collection of general numerical methods that can be
applied to a variety of mathematical and engineering problems.

Key Features:
- Root-finding algorithms (e.g., Newton-Raphson, Bisection Method).
- Solvers for linear and non-linear systems of equations.
- Interpolation and extrapolation techniques.
- Optimization tools and numerical approximations.

Example:
    from mechnumy.numerical import solve_linear
    solution = solve_linear(A, b)
