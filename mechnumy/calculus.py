"""

This module offers numerical techniques for calculus, including
differentiation and integration. It focuses on approximations for
continuous functions.

Key Features:
- Numerical differentiation methods (e.g., forward, backward, central).
- Integration methods (e.g., Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's Rule).
- Support for handling discrete and continuous data.

Example:
    from mechnumy.calculus import differentiate, integrate
    df = differentiate(func, x)
    integral = integrate(func, a, b)
